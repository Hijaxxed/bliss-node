# bliss-node

This repo is for my hobby website Lethargic Bliss. 
This project is purely as a hobby, and also for educational purposes - to teach myself more about web development.

This project is being developed with Node.js, Express.
For aesthetics I am using the pug(Jade) template engine, and bootstrap.
